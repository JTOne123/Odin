I’m a software developer working in Seattle, Washington. 
I primarily work with the Microsoft .NET stack with SQL Server as my back end. 
In addition to software, I enjoy philosophy, music, reading, video and board games.

I started programming in 2000. 
I cut my teeth on VB 5 & 6. 
From there I worked in C on an embedded Linux device. 
I moved to .NET almost as soon as it came out, and have been coding in C# and VB .NET ever since. 
In 2004 I discovered Uncle Bob through his book [Agile Software Development]. 
I’ve been a practitioner of TDD and Continuous Integration ever since, and have devoted myself to learning how to better apply good design patterns and processes to my work.
